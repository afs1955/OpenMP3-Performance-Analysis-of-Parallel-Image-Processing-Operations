# Parallel-Programming
Implementation of an Image Processing Library for time consuming operations such as Image Blurring,Negation,Edge Detection and Contrast Stretching.
â€¢ Techs:OpenMP, C, libpng library, Pthreads library, linux, etc..
# The project aims to reduce the time required to perform the image processing operations mentioned above. As the image processing operations are independent of each other they can be performed concurrently on cpu cores.
